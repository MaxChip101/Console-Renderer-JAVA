# Console-Renderer-JAVA
This is an idea I made that renders text onto a console like a screen made in java


Commands:


ConsoleRenderer.Screen_Setup(int WIDTH, int HEIGHT);

| 

L> Sets up the screen width and height for rendering.



ConsoleRenderer.Coordinate(int X, int Y, String char);
|

L> Edits the coordinate slected and replaces the position with a character (String has to be one character long).


ConsoleRenderer.Render();

|

L> Renders the coordinates onto the console.
